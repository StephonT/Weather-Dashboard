# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

In this challenge, I used API calls from the Open Weather website to get current and future weather data from different cities. After calling the API, I created functions that will allow the data to display in its appropriate containers. Once a city is searched, the user will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When the current weather is displayed for that city, the user will see the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When viewing the UV index, the user is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. When the 5 Day Forecast is displayed, the user is presented with the dates, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. Finally, when the user clicks on a city in the search history, then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city. Take a look at the screen shot below!
